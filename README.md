# d20 SRD character sheet

A D&D 3.5 cloud based character sheet

## Description

Welcome to this attempt for a digital charactersheet. I started this in Excel, but i f***ing hate Excel (blame business users), so here we are. It is in no way done and probably never will be. It is also in no way architecturally sound or a good example of how you should build a webapp. For now it's just a autocalculation of abilities, saves and skills and an HP tracker. It is not thoroughly tested, there's no login, no auth at the moment every character for everyone who can reach the site (I disabled all the delete functions). I will provide no support whatsoever and I am in no way responsible for what happens to your game if you use this tools.

Happy hunting!

## Description

For the moment it is based on our home game, but I expect to move it further along to provide a more vanilla experience an a more generic 3.5 functionality.
